## Updating to new version of game
If you are trying to add compatibility for a new version of the game, here is how you can do it.

 1. Find breaking changes from [HERE](https://datapack.wiki/wiki/info/breaking-changes)
 2. Create new branch from the main branch with title of the new version (e.g. 1.21.5)
 3. Update the code to fix the breaking changes
 4. Commit to the new branch
 5. Create PR to merge into main branch
 6. Review code
 
 Once reviewed, you can merge the PR into the main branch **BUT DO NOT** delete the branch you created. If a user ever wants to use it for a previous version, then they can go to the branch of the version they want to use.
